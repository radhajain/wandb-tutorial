Tutorial for Weights &amp; Biases

In this repository, you will find example projects that you can run. You will need a Github account and a Weights & Biases account.

1. To get started, first clone the repository:

git clone http://github.com/radhajain/wandb-tutorial

2. Next, install the requirements required to run the scripts

cd wandb-tutorial
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Finally, initialize the wandb directory and follow the instructions

wandb init

4. Now run the script as normal, and open the web link shown in terminal:

python keras-fashion.py

This opens a run page in Weights & Biases. From here you can track the performance of your model as well as view any images 
used in training.

Congratulations you've run your first run! You're ready to try out W&B on your own projects.
